name=QTraffic
description=Traffic Emission and Energy Consumption Model (TEM) for open-source QGIS
about=QTraffic model is able to quantify traffic emission and energy consumption on the urban level.
    It has been developed based on the updated European methodology for emission factors and a novel technology for producing dynamic interactive data visualization. 
    The emission and energy consumption model is implemented as a plugin for open-source QGIS and integrates D3.js library with the Python programming.
    NOTE for Linux users:
    TEM Algoritm was developed and compiled in Fortran under Win environment. To allow execution in a Linux environment
    it's necessary to have wine (https://www.winehq.org/) installed.
    LIMITATIONS: The plugin manages only shapfiles
