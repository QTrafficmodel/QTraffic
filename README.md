QTraffic - Traffic Emission and Energy Consumption Model for open-source QGIS

QTraffic model is able to quantify traffic emission and energy consumption on the urban level.
It has been developed based on the updated European methodology for emission factors and
a novel technology for producing dynamic interactive data visualization. 
The emission and energy consumption model is implemented as a plugin for open-source QGIS and
integrates D3.js library with the Python programming.

Developped by Luigi Pirelli inside EMSURE project with technical support by Oxana Tchepel, Daniela Dias

NOTE for Linux users:
TEM Algoritm was developed and compied in Fortran under Win environment. To allow execution in a Linux environment
it's necessary to have wine (https://www.winehq.org/) installed.

LIMITATIONS: Due to algorithm structure, the plugin manages only shapefiles
